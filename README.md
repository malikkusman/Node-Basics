## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google and is designed to execute JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it highly efficient for I/O-intensive tasks.

## Installation

To get started with Node.js, visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided there.

## Getting Started

To create a simple Node.js application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project.

2. Initialize a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file.

3. Follow the prompts to configure your project.

4. Create a new JavaScript file and add your Node.js code.

5. Run your Node.js application.

## Node.js Modules

Node.js provides a modular system for organizing and reusing code. You can create your own modules or use built-in modules.

## Asynchronous Programming

Node.js is known for its non-blocking, asynchronous programming model. This allows you to perform I/O operations and other tasks without blocking the execution of the entire program.

## File System Operations

Node.js provides a built-in `fs` module for working with the file system. You can read, write, and manipulate files using this module.

## HTTP Server

Node.js can be used to create web servers. The built-in `http` module allows you to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## NPM - Node Package Manager

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows you to easily manage and install packages and dependencies for your projects.

## Common Node.js Frameworks

There are several popular Node.js frameworks and libraries available for building web applications and APIs, including Express.js, Koa, and Nest.js. These frameworks simplify the process of creating robust and scalable applications.
